# SKRollo-app

## Web Application for Calculating Materials for Manufacturing Protective Shutters

### Overview

&emsp;SKRollo-app is a web-based application designed specifically for engineers working in manufacturing industries that produce external protective aluminum shutters.\
&emsp;The primary purpose of this application is to streamline the process of generating a comprehensive list of materials required for the production of a specific shutter model.\
&emsp;By inputting specific parameters and data, engineers can easily obtain a detailed list of components and materials needed to construct the desired protective shutter.

### Key Features

+ **Intuitive User Interface:** The application features an interface with logically connected blocks, making it user-friendly and efficient to use.
+ **Input Data:** Engineers will be prompted to enter essential data, such as the shutter's dimensions, design specifications, and other relevant criteria.
+ **Accurate Calculations:** Based on the input provided, the application performs precise calculations to determine the required quantity and specifications of materials needed.
+ **Comprehensive Material List:** The application generates a comprehensive list of components, including article numbers, lengths, and quantities, ensuring that no crucial materials are overlooked.
+ **Export Functionality:** Engineers can save the generated material list in JSON format, making it easy to share with production teams or suppliers.


### How It Works

+ **Input Data:** Upon accessing SKRollo-app, engineers will be presented with an interface containing clearly defined input fields. These fields will prompt users to enter specific parameters, such as the shutter's dimensions, desired materials, and any additional customizations.
+ **Calculation Process:** Once all necessary data is input, the application's powerful algorithms will process the information and perform accurate calculations based on industry-standard formulas.
+ **Material List Generation:** After completing the calculations, SKRollo-app will compile a detailed list of materials, including their respective article numbers, lengths, and quantities, required for the manufacturing process.
+ **Export and Collaboration:** The final material list can be easily exported in JSON format, enabling seamless collaboration between engineers and production teams. Additionally, this export feature facilitates ordering from suppliers by sharing precise material requirements.
