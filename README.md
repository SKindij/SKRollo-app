## Web App for Calculating Materials for Manufacturing Protective Shutters

### Overview

&emsp;SKRollo-app is a web-based application designed specifically for engineers working in manufacturing industries that produce external protective aluminum shutters.\
&emsp;The primary purpose of this application is to streamline the process of generating a comprehensive list of materials required for the production of a specific shutter model.\
&emsp;By inputting specific parameters and data, engineers can easily obtain a detailed list of components and materials needed to construct the desired protective shutter.

### Key Features

+ **Intuitive User Interface:**
  - The application features an interface with logically connected blocks, making it user-friendly and efficient to use.
+ **Input Data:**
  - Engineers will be prompted to enter essential data, such as the shutter's dimensions, design specifications, and other relevant criteria.
+ **Accurate Calculations:**
  - Based on the input provided, the application performs precise calculations to determine the required quantity and specifications of materials needed.
+ **Comprehensive Material List:**
  - The application generates a comprehensive list of components, including article numbers, lengths, and quantities, ensuring that no crucial materials are overlooked.
+ **Export Functionality:**
  - Engineers can save the generated material list in JSON format, making it easy to share with production teams or suppliers.


### How It Works

+ **Input Data:**
  - Upon accessing SKRollo-app, engineers will be presented with an interface containing clearly defined input fields.
  - These fields will prompt users to enter specific parameters, such as the shutter's dimensions, desired materials, and any additional customizations.
+ **Calculation Process:**
  - Once all necessary data is input, the application's powerful algorithms will process the information and perform accurate calculations based on industry-standard formulas.
+ **Material List Generation:**
  - After completing the calculations, SKRollo-app will compile a detailed list of materials, including their respective article numbers, lengths, and quantities, required for the manufacturing process.
+ **Export and Collaboration:**
  - The final material list can be easily exported in JSON format, enabling seamless collaboration between engineers and production teams.
  - Additionally, this export feature facilitates ordering from suppliers by sharing precise material requirements.


### Technology Stack

+ **Vanilla JavaScript:**
  - The application's core functionality was implemented using pure JavaScript, without relying on any external libraries or frameworks.
  - This approach ensures optimal performance and a lightweight codebase.
+ **HTML:**
  - Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) was used to structure the application's user interface, defining the layout and content presentation.
  - Semantically meaningful HTML tags were employed to enhance accessibility and search engine optimization.
+ **CSS:**
  - Cascading Style Sheets were utilized to design and style the application's user interface.
  - The application's appearance was carefully crafted to provide an intuitive and visually appealing experience for users.
+ **Webpack**
  - It acts as a module bundler, enabling us to manage and optimize the application's assets efficiently. 
  - Webpack seamlessly handles JavaScript and CSS files, transforming them into optimized bundles ready for deployment.
