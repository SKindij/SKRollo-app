# SKRollo-app

&emsp;Web application for calculating the list of materials for the production of protective shutters.

&emsp;According to the author's idea, the program interface consists of several logically connected blocks in which the user will enter his data. And the program will display the final result of calculations (_a list of materials with article numbers, their length and quantity_) on the screen, and will also provide an opportunity to save it in a separate file in JSON format.
