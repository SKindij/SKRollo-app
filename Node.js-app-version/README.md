&emsp; For building a web application that calculates the construction of protective shutters, 
there are several Node.js frameworks and libraries you can use along with a database. 

+ **Express.js** provides a lot of useful features, such as middleware, routing, and template engines to build web applications. 
+ **Passport.js** is an authentication middleware for Node.js applications. 
It provides a flexible and modular approach to implementing authentication strategies, such as local authentication, social authentication, and OAuth.
+ As for the database, **MongoDB** is a good choice for this type of application because it is flexible and can handle unstructured data, 
which can be useful when dealing with various types of shutters, profiles, and specifications. 
+ **Mongoose** is an Object-Document Mapping (ODM) library for MongoDB. 
It provides a simple and elegant way to interact with MongoDB databases and helps with schema validation, data modeling, and querying.
+ **Socket.IO** is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between the server and the client. 
It can be used to create chat applications, multiplayer games, and other real-time applications.
